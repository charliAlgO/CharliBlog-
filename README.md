This is a Blog App with React.js and Redux toolkit, this is a fully functional CRUD Application. We will create, Read, Update and Delete posts.

where we also use Redux in managing the States, we use Axios in fetching the Api from a dummy json api server: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts..using a lot of javascript logic, and React.js concepts. 

In this APP you can also show your reaction if the blog post was useful or not by clicking on the reaction buttons.

we also have the TimeAgo features which displays the time of each posts, using date-fns.

This App really utilizes both the Redux Toolkit State management concepts, such as the createSlice, useSelector, useDispatch, Reducers, Extra Reducers. The source code shows codes commented out, thats for the CreateAsyncThunk method,you can uncomment the codes to get a functioning Blog App with the CreateSlice,CreateAsyncthunk method 

But for Normalization and Optimization I used the Redux toolkit and RTK Query method.
